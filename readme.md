# AI-Cloud: A Next-Gen Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Cloud Storage Platform

Cloud storage has become increasingly popular due to its scalability, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and better security measures. The purpose of this project is to build a scaled-down prototype of a future cloud storage service. Methods that can be used include developing client-side software, creating a cloud-based solution, utilizing existing cloud storage APIs, implementing OCR technology, and developing a personalized search feature. The increasing number of cloud storage users and the expanding cloud infrastructure market are driving the growth of the industry. Cloud File Manager is an innovative tool that offers a variety of capabilities for managing and backing up data, making it an invaluable tool for personal and professional use.
